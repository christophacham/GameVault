# GameVault Configuration
# ======================
# Copy this file to config.toml (next to GameVault.exe) and customize.
# All paths can be relative (to the executable) or absolute.

[paths]
# Root directory containing your games to scan
# Examples:
#   game_library = "D:\\Games"
#   game_library = "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Games"
#   game_library = "./games"  (relative to executable)
game_library = "."

# SQLite database file location
# The database will be created automatically on first run
database = "sqlite:./data/gamevault.db?mode=rwc"

# Cache directory for downloaded cover images and metadata
cache = "./cache"

[server]
# Port to run the web server on
# Default: 3000
port = 3000

# Automatically open your default browser when GameVault starts
# Set to false if you prefer to open it manually
auto_open_browser = true

# Network address to bind to
# - "127.0.0.1" = localhost only (more secure, default)
# - "0.0.0.0" = all network interfaces (accessible from other devices)
bind_address = "127.0.0.1"

# ==============================================================================
# Environment Variable Overrides
# ==============================================================================
# You can also configure GameVault using environment variables:
#
#   GAMEVAULT_PATHS__GAME_LIBRARY=D:\Games
#   GAMEVAULT_PATHS__DATABASE=sqlite:./data/games.db?mode=rwc
#   GAMEVAULT_SERVER__PORT=8080
#   GAMEVAULT_SERVER__AUTO_OPEN_BROWSER=false
#
# Legacy environment variables are also supported for backwards compatibility:
#   DATABASE_URL, GAMES_PATH, PORT, HOST
